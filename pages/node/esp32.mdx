# ESP32

## Setup

1. Download the latest [Huebot node firmware](https://github.com/huebot-iot/node/releases/) (look for `mp-esp32-[version].bin`).

2. Follow MicroPython's [deploying the firmware](https://docs.micropython.org/en/latest/esp32/tutorial/intro.html#deploying-the-firmware) documentation but make sure to use the Huebot firmware you just downloaded.

3. This is a good time to setup the ESP32 on the breadboard per [Base Schematic]()

4. Okay, back on your computer - create a new directory for your custom node. In this directory add the [client.py](/node#clientpy) and [config.json](/node#configjson) files. 

5. Upload the files to the ESP32. We use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) with the [PyMakr extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=pycom.Pymakr) to accomplish this (see PyMakr Configuration for details). Unfortunately this might require some Googling if you use a different code editor.

6. Restart your node and confirm it's online by hitting the [`GET /node/online`](http://localhost:3000/hub/api-endpoints#node) endpoint.

ðŸŽ‰ Congrats your node is setup and ready to use! ðŸŽ‰


## PyMakr Configuration
If using PyMakr to upload files, drop the following file in your project:

```json filename="pymakr.conf"
{
    "name": "my-project-name",
    "py_ignore": [
        ".vscode",
        ".gitignore",
        ".git"
    ]
}
```
