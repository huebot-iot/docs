# Overview

import { Callout } from 'nextra/components'

A node refers to a MCU (microcontroller unit) setup as an MQTT client in the Huebot environment. 

## Support

At this time, we only have a [custom MicroPython build](https://github.com/huebot-iot/node/releases/latest) for the ESP32. However, any MCU listed under [MicroPython's downloads](https://micropython.org/download/) section and equipped with WiFi capabilities will also work with the Huebot framework.

    We encourage testing other MCUs and providing feedback or contributing to documentation!
