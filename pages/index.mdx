# Introduction
 
Huebot is an MQTT enabled IoT framework designed to monitor and control microcontrollers (nodes) via REST API. It's easy to install and configure so you only need to code the [MicroPython](https://github.com/micropython/micropython) based nodes to do whatever you want! [Here's an example](/example).

Under the hood Huebot brings together industry leading tooling such as, but not limited to:
* [Mostquitto](https://github.com/eclipse/mosquitto): powerful MQTT broker
* [NestJS](https://github.com/nestjs/nestjs.com): widely used TypeScript-based Node.js framework that is responsible for the REST API and MQTT transporter functionality
* [Redis](https://github.com/redis/redis): In-memory data store leveraged to handle node status and make sensor readings available
* [NGINX](https://github.com/nginx/nginx): Reverse proxy used for directing HTTP and MQTT requests

## Requirements

In addition to a Debian based system, you'll need a wireless network and a WiFi enabed microcontroller (E.g. ESP32). Huebot is built to run on a small single-board computer, like a Raspberry Pi, but if you want to contribute to this project it's recommended that you spin this project up in a Virtual Box or use a mini PC. Read more about [hub development]().

Before installing Huebot make sure the device you'll be using as the hub has [Node.js 16+](https://nodejs.org/en/download) installed and that [NPM's global directory is setup properly](https://docs.npmjs.com/resolving-eacces-permissions-errors-when-installing-packages-globally#manually-change-npms-default-directory). 

Lastly, make sure your hub is connected to the wireless network.

## Getting Started

Install the CLI:
``` {3} copy
npm install -g @huebot/cli
```

Install the Huebot environment:
``` {3} copy
huebot install
```
