# Introduction
 
Huebot is a turnkey MQTT-enabled (and REST API supported) IoT framework for monitoring and controlling microcontrollers (nodes). All complexity is abstracted so you can program your [MicroPython](https://github.com/micropython/micropython) based node to do whatever you want in minutes! [Here's an example](//examples/DS18x20).

Under the hood Huebot brings together industry leading tooling such as, but not limited to:
* [Mostquitto](https://github.com/eclipse/mosquitto): powerful MQTT broker
* [NestJS](https://github.com/nestjs/nestjs.com): widely used TypeScript-based Node.js framework that is responsible for the REST API and MQTT transporter functionality
* [Redis](https://github.com/redis/redis): In-memory data store leveraged to handle node status and make sensor readings available
* [NGINX](https://github.com/nginx/nginx): Reverse proxy used for directing HTTP and MQTT requests

## Requirements

In addition to a Debian based system, you'll need a wireless network and a WiFi enabed microcontroller (E.g. ESP32). Huebot is built to run on a small single-board computer, like a Raspberry Pi, but if you want to contribute to this project it's recommended that you spin it up in a Virtual Box or use a mini PC. Read more about [hub development]().

Before installing Huebot make sure the device you'll be using as the hub has [Node.js 16+](https://nodejs.org/en/download) installed and that [NPM's global directory is setup properly](https://docs.npmjs.com/resolving-eacces-permissions-errors-when-installing-packages-globally#manually-change-npms-default-directory). 

Lastly, make sure your hub is connected to the wireless network.
