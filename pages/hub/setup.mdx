# Hub Setup

## Getting Started

**Node 16+ is required. Make sure it is installed before proceeding.**

SSH into the hub and run the following commands.

1. Install the CLI
``` {3} copy
npm install -g @huebot/cli
```

2. Install the Huebot environment
``` {3} copy
huebot install
```

3. Create an admin user (required for the REST API)
``` {3} copy
huebot create-admin
```

Your hub is setup! Now [test the REST API](/hub/setup#test-rest-api) to confirm connectivity.

## Test REST API

Feel free to use an API platform like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) to speak to the API or just run the below in a terminal!

1. Login 

``` {3} copy
curl -X POST http://[computer name OR IP address]/user/login \
   -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
   -d '{"username": "my_username", "password": "my_password"}'
```

If successful, this request should return an access token and refresh token. You'll use the access token in the next command.

2. Get current user

``` {3} copy
curl http://[computer name OR IP address]/user/me \
   -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
   -H "Authorization: Bearer [access token]" 
```

## Development

Using a single-board computer like a Raspberry Pi is not recommended for development. The extra dependencies along with [webpack's](https://github.com/webpack/webpack) Hot-Module Replacement (HMR) can be too much to handle. We suggest using a PC or [Virtual Box](https://www.virtualbox.org/) running [Ubuntu Server](https://ubuntu.com/download/server). 

[Yarn V2](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install) is required for Huebot development. Make sure it's installed before running the below commands.

1. Clone the repo

``` {3} copy
git clone https://github.com/huebot-iot/huebot.git
```

2. Install the dependencies

``` {3} copy
cd huebot && yarn
```

3. Build the common package

``` {3} copy
yarn workspace @huebot/common build
```

3. Make environment variables available - either create a new `.env` file in the `docker` directory or create a soft symlink to the variables that were configured when you ran `huebot install` 

``` {3} copy
ln -s /usr/local/bin/huebot/.env /home/[username]/huebot/docker/.env
```

4. Start the Docker containers (Note: Make sure you've stopped the production API and MQTT containers)

``` {3} copy
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.dev.yml up
```
